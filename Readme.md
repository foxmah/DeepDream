# Deep-dream
This is deepdream. These are the step to use it on your PC:

 - If you use linux base computer you probably should do these steps:
    - clone or download the project
    - go to file directory
    ```
     $ cd app/
     $ python implement_on_flask.py
    ```
    - then run http://localhost:5000/ in your browser

This project was just to improve the "Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen" tutorial.
So i add a file name video_maker to make video out of frames and probably i will implement it on flask soon.
