# Deep-dream
This is deepdream. These are the step to use it on your PC:

You probably should follow these steps whether you use linux or windows:
1. clone or download the project
2. go to file directory
```
$ cd app/
$ python implement_on_flask.py
```
3. then run http://localhost:5000/ in your browser

This project was just to improve the "Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen" tutorial about deepdream.
So i add a file name video_maker to make video out of frames. and now i'm trying to implement it on flask.
