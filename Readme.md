# Deep-dream
This is deepdream. These are the steps to use it on your PC:

You probably should follow these steps whether you use linux or windows:
1. clone or download the project
2. go to the project directory
```
$ cd app/
$ python implement_on_flask.py
```
3. then run http://localhost:5000/ in your browser

This project's purpose was improving the "Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen" tutorial about deepdream.
So I added a file named video_maker to make a video out of generated frames and a site for GUI.
